                    <br><br>
                    Japan's cities are a testament to its innovative spirit. Tokyo, the bustling capital, is a hub of technology, fashion, and cuisine.
                    From the towering skyscrapers of Shinjuku to the historic temples of Asakusa, Tokyo offers a diverse array of experiences.
                    The city is also famous for its efficient public transportation system, including the Shinkansen, or bullet trains, which symbolize Japan's advancements in engineering.
                    <br><br>
                    In contrast, Kyoto represents the traditional heart of Japan. Once the imperial capital, Kyoto is home to numerous UNESCO World Heritage sites,
                    including the serene Kinkaku-ji (Golden Pavilion) and the historic Fushimi Inari Shrine, known for its thousands of red torii gates. 
                    The city's well-preserved temples, gardens, and geisha districts provide a glimpse into Japan's past.

                <h2>Understanding Hiragana, Katakana, Kanji, and Romaji in Japan</h2>
                <img src="assets/img/article3.jpg" alt="article3" class="featured-image">
                <p>
                    Japan's writing system is unique and complex, comprising four main scripts: Hiragana, Katakana, Kanji, and Romaji.
                    <br><br>
                    Hiragana (ひらがな): This script is used primarily for native Japanese words and grammatical functions.
                    It consists of 46 basic characters, each representing a syllable. Hiragana is often the first script children learn in school.
                    <br><br>
                    Katakana (カタカナ): Katakana is used for foreign words, names, and onomatopoeia. Like Hiragana, it has 46 basic characters,
                    but the shapes are more angular and sharp. It's commonly seen in loanwords and technical terms.
                    <br><br>
                    Kanji (漢字): Kanji are logographic characters borrowed from Chinese. Each character represents a word or a meaningful part of a word.
                    There are thousands of Kanji, but daily use typically involves around 2,000 characters. Kanji adds depth and nuance to the language,
                    often conveying complex meanings.
                    <br><br>
                    Romaji (ローマ字): Romaji is the Romanization of Japanese sounds using the Latin alphabet.
                    It's used primarily for the benefit of non-Japanese speakers, in language learning, and for certain brand names and signage.
                    <br><br>
                    Together, these scripts form a rich and versatile writing system that reflects Japan's history and cultural evolution.
